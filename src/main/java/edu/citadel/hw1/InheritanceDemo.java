        //    name=John Doe, hireDate=2009-05-21, wageRate=50.5, hourWorked=160.0
        //    name=Jane Doe, hireDate=2005-09-01, wageRate=150.5, hourWorked=80.0

        //3. Create two salaried employees as follows and add them to the list
        //    name=Moe Howard, hireDate=2004-01-01, annualSalary=75000.0
        //    name=Curly Howard, hireDate=2018-01-01, annualSalary=105000.0

        //4. Print “`List of Employees (before sorting)`” followed by a listing of each employee, one per employee
        //per line. Employees should be written in the order that the employee was added to the list.
        System.out.println("List of Employees (before sorting)");
        for (Employee employee : employees) {
            System.out.println(employee);

        System.out.println();

        //5.  Using class `Collections` from `java.util, call Collections.sort()` passing the list of employees as an
        //argument. This will use your `compareTo()` method to sort the list based on monthly pay, so that employees
        //with lower monthly pay will be in the list before those with higher monthly pay.



        //6. Print “`List of Employees (after sorting)`” followed by a listing of each employee, one per employee
        //per line. Employees should now be written in the sorted order. (The order of the listing will not be obvious
        //at this point, but it will become more meaningful after the next few steps where we print the monthly pay for
        //each employee.)


        //Print out a blank line.
